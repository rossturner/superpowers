# Writing Plans

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS — Read Before Anything Else

**You MUST NOT call `EnterPlanMode` or `ExitPlanMode` at any point during this skill.** This skill operates in normal mode. Calling `EnterPlanMode` traps the session in plan mode where Write/Edit are restricted. Calling `ExitPlanMode` breaks the workflow. If you feel the urge to call either, STOP — follow this skill's instructions instead.

## Overview

Write comprehensive implementation plans assuming the engineer has zero context for our codebase and questionable taste. Document everything they need to know: which files to touch for each task, code, testing, docs they might need to check, how to test it. Give them the whole plan as bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.

Assume they are a skilled developer, but know almost nothing about our toolset or problem domain. Assume they don't know good test design very well.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the writing-plans skill to create the implementation plan."

**Save plans to:** `docs/superpowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`
- (User preferences for plan location override this default)

## Transient Artifacts

The spec and the plan are transient working documents — typically deleted shortly after the feature ships. Two rules follow:

- Nothing outside `docs/superpowers/` may reference the spec or plan. Do not point shipped code, comments, docstrings, README, or durable docs at these files. References *within* `docs/superpowers/` (e.g. the plan header pointing at its own execution skill) are fine.
- The spec and plan are never the feature's documentation. When a feature needs durable documentation, it lives in the README, in `docs/` outside `docs/superpowers/`, or in the code itself.

## Scope Check

If the spec covers multiple independent subsystems, it should have been broken into sub-project specs during brainstorming. If it wasn't, suggest breaking this into separate plans — one per subsystem. Each plan should produce working, testable software on its own.

## File Structure

Before defining tasks, map out which files will be created or modified and what each one is responsible for. This is where decomposition decisions get locked in.

- Design units with clear boundaries and well-defined interfaces. Each file should have one clear responsibility.
- You reason best about code you can hold in context at once, and your edits are more reliable when files are focused. Prefer smaller, focused files over large ones that do too much.
- Files that change together should live together. Split by responsibility, not by technical layer.
- In existing codebases, follow established patterns. If the codebase uses large files, don't unilaterally restructure - but if a file you're modifying has grown unwieldy, including a split in the plan is reasonable.

This structure informs the task decomposition. Each task should produce self-contained changes that make sense independently.

## Task Granularity

**Each task is a coherent unit of work that produces a testable, committable outcome.**

See `skills/shared/task-format-reference.md` for the full granularity guide.

Key principle: TDD cycles happen WITHIN tasks, not as separate tasks. A task is "Implement X with tests" — the red-green-refactor steps are execution detail inside the task, not task boundaries.

**Scope test:**
1. Can it be verified independently? (if no → too small)
2. Does it touch more than one concern? (if yes → too big)
3. Would it get its own commit? (if no → merge with adjacent task)

## Final Task: Documentation

The final task of a plan is generally to update any relevant durable documentation. Most features need none — when that is the case, say so explicitly rather than inventing a documentation task. When documentation is warranted, the final task names exactly which durable location to update (README, `docs/` outside `docs/superpowers/`, code docstrings) and never points at the spec or plan.

## Plan Document Header

**Every plan MUST start with this header:**

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers-extended-cc:subagent-driven-development to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this builds]

**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences about approach]

**Tech Stack:** [Key technologies/libraries]

**User decisions (already made):** [One line per decision the user made during brainstorming/planning, quotable. "none" if none.]

---
```

### Deferred decisions

If the plan schedules questions for the user (a DECIDE list, an AskUserQuestion step), each question MUST:
- Cite why it is still open despite the header decisions. If a recorded decision answers it, answer from the record — do not re-ask.
- Carry the facts needed to answer it in the option descriptions: name the artifact AND its role/state (e.g. "stale GitHub mirror, last push 2026-03-25 — separate from your local-tools dev home"), and state what does NOT change under each option.
- Recommend nothing that contradicts a recorded decision. That is a plan failure (same severity as No Placeholders).

## Task Structure

````markdown
### Task N: [Component Name]

**Goal:** [One sentence — what this task produces]

**Files:**
- Create: `exact/path/to/file.py`
- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.py:123-145`
- Test: `tests/exact/path/to/test.py`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] [Concrete, testable criterion]
- [ ] [Another criterion]

**Verify:** `exact test command` → expected output

**Steps:**

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```python
def test_specific_behavior():
    result = function(input)
    assert result == expected
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: FAIL with "function not defined"

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

```python
def function(input):
    return expected
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: PASS

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/path/test.py src/path/file.py
git commit -m "feat: add specific feature"
```
````

## No Placeholders

Every step must contain the actual content an engineer needs. These are **plan failures** — never write them:
- "TBD", "TODO", "implement later", "fill in details"
- "Add appropriate error handling" / "add validation" / "handle edge cases"
- "Write tests for the above" (without actual test code)
- "Similar to Task N" (repeat the code — the engineer may be reading tasks out of order)
- Steps that describe what to do without showing how (code blocks required for code steps)
- References to types, functions, or methods not defined in any task

## Remember
- Exact file paths always
- Complete code in every step — if a step changes code, show the code
- Exact commands with expected output
- DRY, YAGNI, TDD, frequent commits

## Self-Review

After writing the complete plan, look at the spec with fresh eyes and check the plan against it. This is a checklist you run yourself — not a subagent dispatch.

**1. Spec coverage:** Skim each section/requirement in the spec. Can you point to a task that implements it? List any gaps.

**2. Placeholder scan:** Search your plan for red flags — any of the patterns from the "No Placeholders" section above. Fix them.

**3. Type consistency:** Do the types, method signatures, and property names you used in later tasks match what you defined in earlier tasks? A function called `clearLayers()` in Task 3 but `clearFullLayers()` in Task 7 is a bug.

If you find issues, fix them inline. No need to re-review — just fix and move on. If you find a spec requirement with no task, add the task.

## Finish: Commit and Halt

The plan is a document. Task creation belongs to `subagent-driven-development`, which builds the task list from the plan at execution time. The plan `.md` records any user-gate intent in prose so that skill can act on it.

When the plan and Self-Review are complete:

1. **Commit** the plan document.
2. **Stop**, with a short message:

> Plan written and committed to `docs/superpowers/plans/<filename>.md`. Recommend `/compact`, then invoke `subagent-driven-development` to execute it.

Stay stopped here — the next move is the user's.
