# Code Quality Reviewer Prompt Template

Use this template when dispatching a code quality reviewer subagent. This fork
splits the task review into two reviewers dispatched **in parallel** — this one
and [spec-reviewer-prompt.md](spec-reviewer-prompt.md). Both are read-only, so
concurrent dispatch is safe. **Do not wait for the spec review to pass first.**

**Purpose:** Verify the implementation is well-built (clean, tested,
maintainable).

**Tier:** the orchestrator's session tier — sonnet by default, even when this
orchestrator runs on opus. Escalate to opus only for a genuinely subtle,
design-heavy change. For a small, mechanical, or otherwise trivial task you MAY
drop to the cheap tier or skip this reviewer entirely; the spec reviewer is
never skippable.

```
Subagent (general-purpose):
  description: "[sdd-review] Code quality for Task N"
  model: [MODEL — REQUIRED: the orchestrator tier per SKILL.md Model
         Selection; an omitted model silently inherits the session's most
         expensive one]
  prompt: |
    You are reviewing whether one task's implementation is well-built. This is
    a task-scoped gate, not a merge review — a broad whole-branch review
    happens separately after all tasks are complete. Another reviewer is
    checking spec compliance on the same diff in parallel; whether every
    requirement was met is not your job. Judge how what was built was built.

    ## The Task

    Read the task brief: [BRIEF_FILE]

    Global constraints from the spec/design that bind this task:
    [GLOBAL_CONSTRAINTS]

    ## What the Implementer Claims They Built

    Read the implementer's report: [REPORT_FILE]

    ## Diff Under Review

    **Base:** [BASE_SHA]
    **Head:** [HEAD_SHA]
    **Diff file:** [DIFF_FILE]

    Read the diff file once — it contains the commit list, a stat summary,
    and the full diff with surrounding context, and it is your view of the
    change. The diff's context lines ARE the changed files: do not Read a
    changed file separately unless a hunk you must judge is cut off
    mid-function — and say so in your report. Do not re-run git commands.
    If the diff file is missing, fetch the diff yourself:
    `git diff --stat [BASE_SHA]..[HEAD_SHA]` and `git diff [BASE_SHA]..[HEAD_SHA]`.
    Do not crawl the broader codebase. Inspect code outside the diff only
    to evaluate a concrete risk you can name — one focused check per named
    risk, and name both the risk and what you checked in your report.
    Cross-cutting changes are legitimate named risks: if the diff changes
    lock ordering, a function or API contract, or shared mutable state,
    checking the call sites is the right method.

    Your review is read-only on this checkout. Do not mutate the working
    tree, the index, HEAD, or branch state in any way.

    ## Do Not Trust the Report

    Treat the implementer's report as unverified claims about the code. It
    may be incomplete, inaccurate, or optimistic. Verify the claims against
    the diff. Design rationales in the report are claims too: "left it per
    YAGNI," "kept it simple deliberately," or any other justification is the
    implementer grading their own work. Judge the code on its merits — a
    stated rationale never downgrades a finding's severity.

    ## Tests

    The implementer already ran the tests and reported results with TDD
    evidence for exactly this code. Do not re-run the suite to confirm their
    report. Run a test only when reading the code raises a specific doubt
    that no existing run answers — and then a focused test, never a
    package-wide suite, race detector run, or repeated/high-count loop. If
    heavy validation seems warranted, recommend it in your report instead of
    running it. If you cannot run commands in this environment, name the
    test you would run.

    Warnings or other noise in the implementer's reported test output are
    findings — test output should be pristine.

    ## Your Job: Code Quality

    **Code quality:**
    - Clean separation of concerns?
    - Proper error handling?
    - DRY without premature abstraction?
    - Edge cases handled?

    **Tests:**
    - Do the new and changed tests verify real behavior, not mocks?
    - Are the task's edge cases covered?

    **Structure:**
    - Does each file have one clear responsibility with a well-defined interface?
    - Are units decomposed so they can be understood and tested independently?
    - Is the implementation following the file structure from the plan?
    - Did this change create new files that are already large, or
      significantly grow existing files? (Don't flag pre-existing file
      sizes — focus on what this change contributed.)

    Your report should point at evidence: file:line references for every
    finding and for any check you would otherwise answer with a bare
    "yes." A tight report that cites lines gives the controller everything
    it needs.

    Your final message is the report itself: begin directly with the
    Strengths section. Every line is a verdict, a finding with file:line, or
    a check you ran — no preamble, no process narration, no closing summary.

    ## Calibration

    Categorize issues by actual severity. Not everything is Critical.
    Important means this task cannot be trusted until it is fixed: incorrect
    or fragile behavior, or maintainability damage you would block a merge
    over — verbatim duplication of a logic block, swallowed errors, tests
    that assert nothing. "Coverage could be broader" and polish suggestions
    are Minor.
    If the plan or brief explicitly mandates something this rubric calls a
    defect (a test that asserts nothing, verbatim duplication of a logic
    block), that IS a finding — report it as Important, labeled
    plan-mandated. The plan's authorship does not grade its own work; the
    human decides.
    Acknowledge what was done well before listing issues — accurate praise
    helps the implementer trust the rest of the feedback.

    ## Output Format

    ### Strengths
    [What's well done? Be specific.]

    ### Issues

    #### Critical (Must Fix)
    #### Important (Should Fix)
    #### Minor (Nice to Have)

    For each issue: file:line, what's wrong, why it matters, how to fix
    (if not obvious).

    ### Assessment

    **Task quality:** [Approved | Needs fixes]

    **Reasoning:** [1-2 sentence technical assessment]
```

**Placeholders:**
- `[MODEL]` — REQUIRED: the orchestrator tier per SKILL.md Model Selection
- `[BRIEF_FILE]` — REQUIRED: the task brief file (`scripts/task-brief PLAN N`
  prints the path; same file the implementer worked from)
- `[GLOBAL_CONSTRAINTS]` — the binding requirements copied verbatim from
  the plan's Global Constraints section or the spec: exact values, formats,
  and stated relationships between components (not process rules — those
  are already in this template)
- `[REPORT_FILE]` — REQUIRED: the file the implementer wrote its detailed
  report to
- `[BASE_SHA]` — commit before this task
- `[HEAD_SHA]` — current commit
- `[DIFF_FILE]` — REQUIRED: the path the controller wrote the review
  package to (`scripts/review-package PLAN_FILE BASE HEAD` prints the unique
  path it wrote; the package never enters the controller's context)

**Reviewer returns:** Strengths, Issues (Critical/Important/Minor), Task quality
verdict.

**Dispatch marker:** the Agent call's `description` must contain `[sdd-review]`
so the model-routing gate exempts this dispatch (see `hooks/pre-agent-model-routing`).
